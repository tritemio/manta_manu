In both ALEX, PAX have four basic photon streams: 
\(F_{DexDem}, F_{DexAem}, F_{AexDem}, F_{AexAem}\).
In ALEX, \(F_{AexDem}\) only contains only background 
because there is no fluorescent emission in the D
spectral band during A-laser excitation.
In PAX, there is a period with only D excitation
that we denote as \(Dex\), and a period with both D and A
excitation from
both D and A lasers. We could call this the
