Among the solution-based single-molecule FRET (smFRET)
techniques, smFRET microsecond alternated excitation (smFRET-μsALEX)\cite{Lee_2005} is . In smFRET-μsALEX two exciting lasers are alternated with a
period of a few tens o microseconds and the fluorescent emission is
detected in two spectral bands (donor and acceptor, or D and A) by two 
separate detectors. The use of two lasers for excitation allows separating singly from doubly labeled species, greatly extending the range of samples that is possible to resolve. For example, dual-laser exitation allows separating D-only from 0 or low FRET species that would be undistinguishable with only a single excitation laser.

Single-molecule FRET periodic acceptor excitation (smFRET-PAX) \cite{Doose_2007} is a technique closely realted to smFRET-μsALEX where one laser is constantly ON and a second laser is alternated. This approach allows simplifying the optical
setup while maintating the same advantages of smFRET-μsALEX, namely the abilty
to resolve species based on the number of attached dyes.
