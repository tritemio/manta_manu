Among the solution-based single-molecule FRET (smFRET)
methods, *microsecond alternated excitation* 
(smFRET-μsALEX)\cite{Lee_2005} is one of the most powerful
methods. In smFRET-μsALEX two exciting lasers are alternated with a
period of a few tens o microseconds and the fluorescent emission is
detected in two spectral bands (donor and acceptor, or D and A) by two 
separate detectors. Using two alternating lasers for excitation,
a family of techniques dubbed ALEX\cite{Kapanidis_2005}, allows separating 
singly- from doubly-labeled species, greatly extending the range of subpopulations that is possible to resolve in a given sample. 
As an example, dual-laser exitation allows separating D-only from 0 or low FRET species that would be undistinguishable with only a single excitation laser.

smFRET *periodic acceptor excitation* (smFRET-PAX) \cite{Doose_2007} is a technique closely related to smFRET-μsALEX where one laser is constantly ON and a second laser is alternated. This approach allows simplifying the optical
setup while maintating the same advantages of smFRET-μsALEX, namely the abilty
to resolve species based on the number of attached dyes.
