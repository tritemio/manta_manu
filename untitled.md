One of the most commonly used techniques for solution-based single-molecule FRET
experiments is called single-molecule FRET microsecond alternated excitation (smFRET-μsALEX). In smFRET-μsALEX two exciting lasers are alternated with a
period of a few tens o microseconds and the fluorescent emission is
detected in two (donor and acceptor, or D and A) spectral bands by two 
separate detectors. The use of two lasers for excitation allows separating singly from doubly labeled species, greatly extending the range of samples that is possible to resolve. For example, as opposed to smFRETan advantage of a dual-laser exitation 
compared to a single-laser excitation, is the abiltiy to separate D-only from 0 or low FRET species,  that are unresolvable in  advantage is the ability to separate D-only and A-only molecules from the ones undergoing FRET FERTad greatly improving the (smFRET) experiemtnsSingle-molecule FRET periodic acceptor excitation (smFRET-PAX) \cite{Doose_2007} measurements are similar to single-molecule FRET microsecond alternated excitation (smFRET-μsALEX). In both cases measurements using two lasers to excite freely-diffusing molecules, the
donor (D) laser is constantly on, while the acceptor (A) laser modulated
turning it ON and OFF with a period of a few tens of microseconds.
