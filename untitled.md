Single-molecule FRET periodic acceptor excitation (smFRET-PAX)~\cite{Doose_2007} measurements are similar to single-molecule FRET microsecond alternated excitation measurements using two lasers, the
donor (D) laser is constantly on, while the acceptor (A) laser modulated
turning it ON and OFF with a period of a few tens of microseconds
