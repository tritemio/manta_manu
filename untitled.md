One of the most commonly used techniques for solution-based single-molecule FRET
experiments is called single-molecule FRET microsecond alternated excitation (smFRET-μsALEX). In smFRET-μsALEX two exciting lasers are alternated with a
period of a few tens o microseconds and the fluorescent emission is
detected in two (donor and acceptor, or D and A) spectral bands by two 
separate detectors. The use of two lasers for excitation allows separating singly and doubly labeled species. IN particular, a  greatly improving the (smFRET) experiemtnsSingle-molecule FRET periodic acceptor excitation (smFRET-PAX) \cite{Doose_2007} measurements are similar to single-molecule FRET microsecond alternated excitation (smFRET-μsALEX). In both cases measurements using two lasers to excite freely-diffusing molecules, the
donor (D) laser is constantly on, while the acceptor (A) laser modulated
turning it ON and OFF with a period of a few tens of microseconds.
