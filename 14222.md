In ALEX we have four basic photon streams: 
\(F_{DexDem}, F_{DexAem}, F_{AexDem}, F_{AexAem}\).
The \(F_{AexDem}\) stream only contains background 
because there is no fluorescent emission in the D
spectral band during A-laser excitation.
In PAX, there is a period with only D excitation
that we denote as \(D_{ex}\), and a period with both D and A
excitations that we call \(DA_{ex}\).
With this convention, we can name the four photon stream in PAX
simply replacing \(A_{ex}\) with \(DA_{ex}\):
\(F_{DexDem}, F_{DexAem}, F_{DAexDem}, F_{DAexAem}\).
Note however that \(F_{DAexDem}\) in PAX contains
fluorescent signal because of the D laser excitation.
